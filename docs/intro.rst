The goal was to create a system in which a user can be instructed how to playback a tune on a piano, which they either heard played live or from a recording. No prior knowledge on playing the piano would be required, they would just need to wear the gloves that weâ€™d produced. These gloves would have haptic motors on each finger, indicating to the user when to actuate each finger press. Initially, the user would assign a note to each finger, allowing a tune of 10 different notes to be played. 

Below is the basic flow diagram for the initial implementation of the system.
